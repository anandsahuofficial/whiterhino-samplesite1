                 <h4><b> <strong> Aromaticity Switching in Redox-Active Molecules</strong></b></h4> 
                  <p><br> The di-reduced state of the naphthalene moiety and its congeners have long captivated chemists as it remains elusive to stabilize these intrinsically reactive electron-rich -systems. Herein we report the synthesis and first isolation of two-electron (2e-) reduced, highly electron-rich naphthalenediimides (NDIs). The doubly-zwitterionic structure is observed for the first time in a naphthalene moiety and validated by single crystal X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic methods.The NICS, NICS-XY, Gauge-Including Magnetically Induced Currents (GIMIC) and AICD calculations revealed redox switching of the antiaromatic and aromatic states at the naphthalene and the imide rings, respectively, in the di-reduced system compared to the related rings of the 2e- oxidized form. The substituents at the axial- and core-positions tune the antiaromatic/aromatic states and the electron donor ability <br>

             <h4><b><strong> Synthesis of Anticancerous Molecules</strong></b></h4> 
              <p><br> Naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives have been shown to exhibit promising antineoplastic properties. In the current study, we assessed the anticancer and anti-bacterial properties of di-substituted NDI derivative. The naphthalene-bis-hydrazimide, 1, negatively affected the cell viability of three cancer cell lines (AGS, HeLa and PC3) and induced S phase cell cycle arrest along with SubG0/G1 accumulation. Amongst three cell lines, gastric cancer cell line, AGS, showed the highest sensitivity towards the NDI derivative 1. Compound 1 induced extensive DNA double strand breaks causing p53 activation leading to transcription of p53 target gene p21 in AGS cells. Reduction in protein levels of p21 and BRCA1 suggested that 1 treated AGS cells underwent cell death due to accumulation of DNA damage as a result of impaired DNA damage repair. β-catenin downregulation and consequently decrease in levels of c-Myc may have led to 1 induced AGS cell proliferation inhibition.1 induced AGS cell S phase arrest was mediated through CylinA/CDK2 downregulation. The possible mechanisms involved in anticancer activity of 1 includes ROS upregulation, induction of DNA damage, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential causing ATP depletion, inhibition of cell proliferation and downregulation of antiapoptotic factors ultimately leading to mitochondria mediated apoptosis. Further compound 1 also inhibited H. pylori proliferation as well as H. pylori induced morphological changes in AGS cells. These findings suggest that NDI derivative 1 exhibits two-pronged anticancer activity, one by directly inhibiting cancer cell growth and inducing apoptosis and the other by inhibiting H. pylori. <br><br> <b>  Sumiran, Srikanta and Co-workers</b>,<br> <i> Chemical-Biological Interactions, 2019, 304, 106-123.</i></p>
