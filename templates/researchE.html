                 <h4><b> <strong>  Synthesis of a Hybrid Antimalarial Drug</strong></b></h4> 
                  <p><br> Antimalarial drug resistance is a serious obstacle in the persistent quest to eradicate malaria. There is a need for potent chemical agents that are able to act on drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum populations at reasonable concentrations without any related toxicity to the host. By rational drug design, we envisaged to address this issue by generating a novel hybrid drug possessing two pharmacophores that can act on two unique and independent targets within the cell. We synthesized a new class of ciprofloxacin-based hybrid molecules, which have been integrated with acridine, quinolone, sulphonamide and cinnamoyl pharmacophores. We realized a potent chloroquinolone-ciprofloxacin-based antimalarial hybrid (CQ-CFX) whose mechanism of action is unlike that of its parent molecules indicating a unique biological target. CQ-CFX is not only potent against CQ-resistant and susceptible strains of Plasmodium falciparum at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50 values are 63.17 ± 1.2 nM and 25.52 ± 4.45 nM, respectively), but is also not toxic to mammalian and bacterial systems upto 20 μM and 1 μM, respectively. <br>

             <h4><b><strong> Synthesis of Anticancerous Molecules</strong></b></h4> 
              <p><br> Naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivatives have been shown to exhibit promising antineoplastic properties. In the current study, we assessed the anticancer and anti-bacterial properties of di-substituted NDI derivative. The naphthalene-bis-hydrazimide, 1, negatively affected the cell viability of three cancer cell lines (AGS, HeLa and PC3) and induced S phase cell cycle arrest along with SubG0/G1 accumulation. Amongst three cell lines, gastric cancer cell line, AGS, showed the highest sensitivity towards the NDI derivative 1. Compound 1 induced extensive DNA double strand breaks causing p53 activation leading to transcription of p53 target gene p21 in AGS cells. Reduction in protein levels of p21 and BRCA1 suggested that 1 treated AGS cells underwent cell death due to accumulation of DNA damage as a result of impaired DNA damage repair. β-catenin downregulation and consequently decrease in levels of c-Myc may have led to 1 induced AGS cell proliferation inhibition.1 induced AGS cell S phase arrest was mediated through CylinA/CDK2 downregulation. The possible mechanisms involved in anticancer activity of 1 includes ROS upregulation, induction of DNA damage, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential causing ATP depletion, inhibition of cell proliferation and downregulation of antiapoptotic factors ultimately leading to mitochondria mediated apoptosis. Further compound 1 also inhibited H. pylori proliferation as well as H. pylori induced morphological changes in AGS cells. These findings suggest that NDI derivative 1 exhibits two-pronged anticancer activity, one by directly inhibiting cancer cell growth and inducing apoptosis and the other by inhibiting H. pylori. <br><br> <b>  Sumiran, Srikanta and Co-workers</b>,<br> <i> Chemical-Biological Interactions, 2019, 304, 106-123.</i></p>
